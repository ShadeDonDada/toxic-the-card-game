Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   Home Screen: Display the game logo, a brief description of the game, and options to start a new game, view rules, and adjust settings.\n-   New Game Setup: Allow players to input the number of players (2-10), set the prize/points system, and initiate the game.\n-   Game Screen: Display the scenario card, player hands (6 cards each), options to play a card, request an exchange, or pass. Implement counterclockwise play rotation.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f0f0` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#9400D3` (Dark Violet, representing \"toxic\")\n    *   Secondary: `#D8BFD8` (Light Violet, complementing the primary)\n    *   Accent: `#FF69B4` (Bright Pink, for highlights and interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFFF00` (Yellow, for important information)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for readability and a slightly bolder font for headings to emphasize important information.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo 54.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement navigation between the Home Screen, New Game Setup, and Game Screen.\n3.  **UI Components:** Create UI components for displaying cards, player hands, scenario cards, and game controls.\n4.  **Game Logic:** Implement the core game logic, including dealing cards, handling player turns, evaluating responses, and managing the game state.\n5.  **User Interface:** Design the user interface with the specified color scheme and typography.\n6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the app to ensure it functions correctly and is user-friendly.\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-01T18:25:07.702525"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the \"Toxic - The Card Game\" app for React Native + Expo 54.
